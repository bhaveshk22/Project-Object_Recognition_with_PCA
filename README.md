# Object Recognition with Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

This repository focuses on 'Object Recognition with Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)'. It contains a Machine Learning model that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for object recognition. The model demonstrates how dimensionality reduction can be effectively used in recognizing and classifying objects in images. The goal of this project is to explore the power of PCA in the field of computer vision and object recognition.





## Roadmap

**Data Preprocessing**: The first step was to clean and preprocess the data, which included handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

**PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: I used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving as much variance as possible. This helped in reducing computational costs and mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

**Model Training**: I experimented with Support-Vector-machines algorithms before and after Dimensionality Reduction (PCA). Each model was trained and evaluated using R-squared techniques.


## Lessons Learned

This project was a fascinating exploration of the capabilities of PCA and machine learning. It was particularly interesting to see how these techniques can be applied to real-world problems like object recognition.

I’m excited about the potential applications of this project and look forward to exploring more ways to leverage machine learning in the future.
