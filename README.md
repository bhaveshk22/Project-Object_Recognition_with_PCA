# 🔍 Unveiling the Power of Unsupervised Learning: Object Recognition with PCA

This repository is dedicated to 'Unveiling the Power of Unsupervised Learning: Object Recognition with PCA'. It contains a Machine Learning model that leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for object recognition. The model demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning techniques in recognizing and classifying objects in images. The goal of this project is to explore and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning in the field of computer vision.




## Roadmap

**Data Preprocessing**: The first step was to clean and preprocess the data, which included handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

**PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: I used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving as much variance as possible. This helped in reducing computational costs and mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

**Unsupervised Learning**: I trained an unsupervised machine learning model on the transformed data. Without any prior labels, the model was able to identify clusters corresponding to different objects.

**Object Recognition**: The final step was to assign labels to the clusters identified by the model, effectively achieving object recognition.


## Lessons Learned

This project was a fascinating exploration of the capabilities of unsupervised learning and PCA. It was particularly interesting to see how these techniques can be applied to real-world problems like object recognition.

I’m excited about the potential applications of this project and look forward to exploring more ways to leverage machine learning in the future.
